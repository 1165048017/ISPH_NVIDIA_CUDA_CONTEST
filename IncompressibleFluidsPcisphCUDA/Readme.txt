SPH method has a wide application in physics engines such as NVIDIA PhysX. However, it is difficult for SPH to satisfy the incompressibility condition, which leads to compressibility artifact in realistic fluid simulations. To solve this problem, the efficient PCISPH algorithm is used to simulate incompressible fluids. Furthermore, the algorithm is parallelized and optimized on the GPU with CUDA. This has improved the visual realism of the fluids as well as the simulation performance.
